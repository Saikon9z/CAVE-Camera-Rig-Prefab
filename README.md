# CAVE-Camera-Rig-Prefab

Created for the CAVE at CNIB's Community Hub in Toronto. Can be used for any project requiring projection to 2 front screens and 2 lateral screens, and also be easily modified for other multiple display configurations. For Unity3D, built using version 2017.3.
Perspective shift scripts are adapted from official Unity documentation for Camera.projectionMatrix.

Import the package to use the prefab - the prefab includes 4 cameras and a CameraManager that has the multidisplay and perspective shift scripts attached.
Position of cameras and the values in the perspective shift script may need to be adjusted depending on the monitor configuration.
